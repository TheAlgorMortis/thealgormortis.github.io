          Who Am I?

        </h2>
        <p>
          I am a passionate creator, whether it be through developing software,
          writing novels, or producing video games. I am constantly learning new
          skills, which I intend to use with my out-of-the-box thinking to solve
          real world problems. I strive to create media and tools that will aid
          or entertain others. I am enthusiastic, buoyant, and optimistic, with
          relentless determination and ambition. I am reliable and responsible,
          and I care deeply about others. I aim to work towards a green and
          progressive future.

        <p>
          After finishing my undergraduate degree, I will be studying my honours
          in Computer Science. After that, I will be working as a Software
          Engineer at Investec Bank.

          You can toggle between light and dark mode using the Mode button in
          the header button above. Dylan recommends always using darkmode as
          it's better for your eyes and more energy efficient. It also looks
          better. For that reason, it is the default on this site.
